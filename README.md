## Description
This repository contains my code for the Unit 10 project in the Treehouse Techdegree curriculum. This project uses React to create a client for my existing [school database REST API](https://github.com/anmedev/td-unit9-project). The full stack application will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating, and deleting courses in the database.

To make changes to the database, users will be required to create an account and sign in.
